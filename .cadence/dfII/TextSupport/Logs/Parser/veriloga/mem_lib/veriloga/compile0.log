    WARNING (VACOMP-1135):
        "/home/rohit/project/mem_lib/stan_mem/veriloga/veriloga.va", line 91:
        The variable 'rand_seed' is used and no value is assigned to it. The
        default value is 0 for integer, 0.0 for real, and "" for string. If you
        want to use a value other than the default value, assign a value to
        this variable and then use it.
